              Hoon is a powerful and expressive language which builds on the
              Urbit platform to promote complete app interoperability and user
              control. We believe you'll find it to be a pleasantly innovative
              approach to thinking about how computation works and what a
              development experience should be.

          <h3>Primer</h3>
          <div className="md:columns-2 space-y-4 mt-4">
            <p>
              Urbit application development involves the use of the familiar client/server
              stack, where Urbit is the server and the client is any typical client stack.
              It gets more interesting though: Urbit is also an entire operating
              system and ACID datastore. That OS includes a filesystem, HTTP server,
              typed P2P network, and much more to the programmer. These different parts of the
              operating system are called <b>vanes</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clients that interact with Urbit can be web browsers, mobile or
              desktop applications, command lines, or anything else that
              presents a user interface. At time of writing, most clients
              communicate with Urbit over HTTP by sending JSON back and forth,
              primarily via pub/sub APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where Urbit differs from other client/server stacks is that all
              users run their own servers (<b>urbits</b>), and those servers
              talk directly to one another. Because those servers are also
              databases, all users store their own data, which they exchange
              with one another based on application-level logic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Urbit allows programmers to create what are called agents, which
              can be thought of as individual microservices—each one contains
              its own logic, defines its own API, can be started and stopped,
              can interact with the rest of the operating system and other
              agents, and is responsible for storing its own data. The lifecycle
              of agents is managed by the part of the operating system called{" "}
              <b>Gall</b>.
            </p>
            <p className="break-inside-avoid">
              Since Urbit is actually an operating system, not just a server,
              when we talk about an Urbit “application” we could mean any of
              several things:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside flex space-y-2 flex-col">
              <li>
                A web or mobile interface that interacts with one or more agents
                to define something that looks a lot like an “app”
              </li>
              <li>A single agent that runs in the background</li>
              <li>
                A script called a generator that’s executed from Urbit’s own
                command-line shell (called the dojo)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Generators, agents and supporting code are packaged up into{" "}
              <b>desks</b>. These provide a mechanism for packaging up related
              code, and can be shared directly with other users over the
              network—this is how software distribution works on Urbit.
            </p>
            <p>
              All Urbit-side code is written in a purely functional and
              statically typed language called <b>Hoon</b>. Hoon looks kind of
              strange compared to most other programming languages, primarily
              because it’s based on <b>runes</b> rather than keywords. This
              strangeness is due to unfamiliarity rather than any form of
              essential complexity, in much the same way as Chinese appears more
              complex to an English-speaker than, say, Spanish.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s possible to develop for Urbit without learning Hoon by
              learning its client-side HTTP interface; however, investing the
              time to learn Hoon will make you a far more capable Urbit
              developer, so we definitely recommend it.
